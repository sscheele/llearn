MODULE SPEC
	All modules are composed of pages. All pages have layouts and resources.
	Total unpacked size for a package should not exceed 1 MB

RESOURCES
	CONTENT TYPE: Resources may be images or audio.
	LOCATION: On the server, resources may be found at /public/classes/{class.__id}/{page number}/res. Upload packages should be similarly structured, with the base directories being page numbers and each containing a res/ folder, regardless of whether that folder is used on that page.

LAYOUTS
	SYNTAX: Layout syntax should be primarily HTML-like. To ensure security, no form, script, link, or a tags should be allowed. Additionally, the script should eventually be configured so that the page doesn't load any outside resources. 
	TYPES: Layout tags will all be evaluated by Angular on the client-side, and therefore they'll all be attribute directives. However, they can roughly be divided into imperative and declarative tags.
		IMPERATIVE TAGS:
			<play-on-click data-file="word.mp3">Content</play-on-click> - Play "/public/classes/{class.__id}/{page number}/res/word.mp3" whenever "Content" is clicked.
		DECLARATIVE TAGS:
			<quiz-select data-template="quiz.html"></quiz-select> - Get a multiple-choice quiz from .../res/quiz.html
			<quiz-answer data-answer="one|two"></quiz-answer> - Defines one answer for the quiz. If more than one answer is possible, they should be separated by bars.
			<quiz-option>Answer two</quiz-option> - Defines an 
			<quiz-text data-answer="ans" data-check-case="false">Prompt</quiz-text> - A text box will be displayed with a label and a check button. The correct answer will be stored inside the tag (in this case, it's "ans"), and the check-case attribute will tell the engine whether to compare case.
			<local-img data-src="pic1.png"></local-img> - Will automatically route to correct image. The <img> tag shouldn't be allowed.
	LOCATION: Layouts should be located in the base directory of each page, with the name layout.html

EXAMPLE MODULE:
0/
	res/
		sound1.mp3
		pic1.png
	layout.html
1/
	res/
	layout.html

*note - despite the fact that it's empty, the res/ folder still exists in page 1
